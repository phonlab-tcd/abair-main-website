      "whatIsAACQuestion": "What is AAC?",
      "whatIsAACAnswer": "Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) offers life changing access to communication for those with speech related disabilities.  AAC is a variety of strategies, tools and devices that supplement or replace speech including, no-tech methods such as gesture or sign language, low-tech systems including pictures and letterboards and high-tech options which use voice technology, often combining symbols and a keyboard, to offer a full robust vocabulary which afford the user the ability to communicate and engage fully with society.",

      "projectDetailsTitle": "Project Details",
      "projectDetailsDescription": "AAC don Ghaeilge aims to make the Irish language available to AAC users.  This project builds on an initial prototype using CoughDrop and previous accessibility projects by the ABAIR group. It is supported by An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscolaíochta (COGG). Lack of access to high-tech AAC in Irish is a particular problem for those in Irish speaking families both in the Gaeltacht and outside the Gaeltacht and can be a major roadblock in AAC using children’s’ education particularly for those attending gaelscoileanna. The speech output will feature synthetic children’s voices developed within ABAIR for the main dialects of Irish.  We aim for the AAC system to be bilingual with the ability to toggle between Irish and English midsentence, to have built in grammar correctors and to use culturally appropriate language i.e., words specific to Ireland e.g., the GAA, Irish geography etc. A crucial element to this project is a training package for teachers in how to use and integrate AAC don Ghaeilge into their teaching. ",

      "aboutUsTitle": "About Us",
      "aboutUsPin": "ABAIR is a project of the Phonetics and Speech Laboratory at the School of Linguistic, Speech and Communication Sciences, Trinity College Dublin. We've been developing synthetic voices for Irish since 2008. We've covered all three major dialects – Ulster, Connaught and Munster Irish. We're also in the process of developing a speech recognition system for Irish.",
      "aboutUs": "Synthetic voices and speech recognition have been in high demand for the last few years. Devices like Alexa are very popular and there are many uses for speech synthesis. There is no doubt that speech technology will flourish in the future especially now that Artificial Intelligence is improving. We've been providing speech technology for Irish since 2008 and have come a long way. Today ABAIR's technology is used in the fields of education and accessibility and we are planning to develop more. We are currently in the porcess of developing a speech recognition system.",
      "synthesisTitle": "Synthesis",
      "synthesis": " There are a lot of use cases for text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis. It is used in public places, e.g. for announcements at train stations or aiports. TTS synthesis is extremely important for the visually impaired, because it enables them to use computers or smart phones. The amount of teaching material that incorporates TTS synthesis is constantly increasing too. People also like to use TTS synthesis to have newspaper articles read out to them while they are driving or jogging. In fact, TTS synthesis is a must for any language these days.",
      "speechRecognitionTitle": "Speech Recognition",
      "speechRecognition": "Speech recognition enables us to interact with computers by simply 'talking' to them, e.g. when you tell your GPS where to go or when you ask your smart phone for the weather forecast. There's an increasing demand for a speech recognition system for Irish, and ABAIR is currently developing one.",
      "challengeTitle": "The Challenge",
      "challenge": "Compared to major languages such as English and Spanish, there aren't as many resources available for minority languages like Irish. There are far less speakers and thus it is more difficult to build up a data base of recorded speech, which is indispensable for developing synthetic voices or speech recognition systems. Furthermore, experts are needed who understand the sound system and the structure of the language as well as engineers who are skilled in speech processing. That's why there is usually only a handful of people who develop speech technology for minority languages.",
